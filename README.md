# Stanford-CS193p

While working through the iTunes U Stanford CS193p (Spring 2016) course and attempting to do the programming assignments in iOS 10 (course was in iOS 9), I converted the professor-supplied Twitter framework and the CoreDataTableViewController class to the Swift 3 (iOS 10) syntax. This was not a redesign, just a conversion to make it work.  Hopefully it will save you some time if you attempt the same iOS 9 to 10 conversion.
